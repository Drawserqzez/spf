# SPF - Spotify access from the terminal!

So this is a rehash of one of my previous projects, but this time using rust
because I wanna learn more about rust and this felt like a fun project to try
things out =)

## Stuff to read, maybe use
[clap for cli parsing](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/_derive/_tutorial/index.html)

[confy for config](https://docs.rs/confy/latest/confy/index.html)

[reqwest for making http requests towards the spotify api](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/)

[tokio for async?](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/)
